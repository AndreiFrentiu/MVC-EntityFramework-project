# Nemetos-Project-4

The website is a simple example website for a common company. The website has 5 + 2 pages and an admin page where you can login and execute CRUD opperation on the employees of the example company.

In this project you will find 2 Application. We names them "Back End" and "Front End" (but the projects are both backend). 

The Front End project is an Web Mvc Core project that has the classic Controller, Model and View system for an website.

The Back End project is also a Web Mvc Conre project but the project is conencted to a database with employees using Entity Framework and had Api Controllers.

We separated the Content of the site from the Database. When a URL request is made we get the content from the "Front End" project and the Database information from the "Back End" project.
